## Installation

Add this line to your application's [Gemfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/a-gemfile.html):

```ruby
gem 'danger'
```

and then run the following to set up `danger` for your repository

```
danger init
```

## Usage

In CI run `bundle exec danger`.  This will look at your `Dangerfile` and provide some feedback based on that.

## DSL

&nbsp;  | &nbsp; | Danger :no_entry_sign:
-------------: | ------------- | ----
:sparkles: | `lines_of_code` | The total amount of lines of code in the diff
:pencil2:  | `files_modified` |  The list of files modified
:ship: | `files_added` | The list of files added
:recycle: | `files_removed` | The list of files removed
:abc:  | `pr_title` | The title of the PR
:book:  | `pr_body` | The body of the PR
:busts_in_silhouette:  | `pr_author` | The author who submitted the PR

You can then create a `Dangerfile` like the following:

``` ruby
# Easy checks
warn("PR is classed as Work in Progress") if pr_title.include? "[WIP]"

if lines_of_code > 50 && files_modified.include? "CHANGELOG.yml" == false
  fail("No CHANGELOG changes made")
end

# Stop skipping some manual testing
if lines_of_code > 50 && pr_title.include? "ðŸ“±" == false
   fail("Needs testing on a Phone if change is non-trivial")
end

message("This pull request adds #{lines_of_code} new lines")
warn("Author @#{pr_author} is not a contributor") unless ["KrauseFx", "orta"].include?(pr_author)
```

## Constraints

* **GitHub** - Built with same-repo PRs in mind
* **Git** - Built with master as the merge branch

## Advanced

You can access more detailed information by accessing the following variables

&nbsp; | Danger :no_entry_sign:
------------- | ----
`env.github.pr_json` | The full JSON for the pull request
`env.git.diff` | The full [GitDiff](https://github.com/schacon/ruby-git/blob/master/lib/git/diff.rb) file for the diff.
`env.ci_source` | To get information like the repo slug or pull request ID
